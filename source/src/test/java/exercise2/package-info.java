/**
 * Problem Description
 * 
 * You should implement the {@link exercise2.OccorrencesCounter#count()} method.
 * This method is intend to count the occurrences of words on a file, returning
 * a {@link java.util.Map<String,Integer>} containing the words and the number
 * of occurrences of that word.
 * 
 * There are some restrictions that should be considered:
 * 
 * You should keep either the {@link exercise2.OccorrencesCounter#count()} or
 * the {@link exercise2.FileParser#next()} method signatures. You can add other
 * public methods though.
 * 
 * There are three input example files on the 'test/resource' folder, your
 * solution should be able to handle all of them. An utility class is provided
 * for you to load those files - see the
 * {@link exercise2.FileUtils#openFile(String)} method.
 * 
 * Bonus Track: If you finish the problem, you should modify your solution to
 * make possible choose to count characters or words occurrences.
